    "To fulfil our task of creating diverse teams, we interpreted the concept of 'diversity' to mean having a variety of CGPAs, genders and school affiliations. Such diversity is important as it allows us to create fair and inclusive teams that bring together people with different perspectives, experiences, and strengths. To achieve such fairness, each team should have members of differing academic abilities, genders and school backgrounds.\n",

    "Our top priorities are CGPA and gender first, followed by school affiliation. This is because we feel that CGPA is the strongest factor that will affect a team’s performance for the mini project so each team should have an even spread of stronger to weaker members. Equally important is gender diversity, so we ensure that each team has either 3 males, 2 females or 3 females, 2 males when possible."
